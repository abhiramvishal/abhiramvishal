# Hi, I'm Abhi (Gopi Abhiram Vishal) 👋  

AI-focused engineer with a strong foundation in **Machine Learning, Robotics (ROS2), and Applied AI systems**, backed by full-stack software experience.  
I enjoy building **end-to-end intelligent systems** — from data and models to real-world deployment on robots and production software.

My recent work focuses on **bridging AI algorithms with physical systems**, including music-driven robot choreography, computer vision pipelines, and ML-powered decision systems.
